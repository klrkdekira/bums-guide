# A bum's guide to motivation

### Problem statement

- hard to persist or commit to and effort
- hard to initiate action to an idea
- lack of physical and emotional energy

### Contemplation

- too messy, organise this later, but it's ok
- one at a time, small comfortable piece, even 5 minutes per day is fine, the main point is to persist
- try to look to enhance the experience of the activity, don't make things punishing
- don't be condensending and bitter
